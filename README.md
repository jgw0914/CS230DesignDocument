# CS230DesignDocument"
The Gaming Room is a company asking me to help with a game called "Draw it or Lose It" available on android. The company asked me to streamline the web version of this game app. The constraints included multiple people being on each team, and having multiple teams involved. Running the app on Android, Apple as well as PC while also telling users if their name is free or not. I feel I was able to document and write down the constraints as well as the differences of each operating system really efficiently. I think being able to work through each piece of the document at a time and not all at once, allowed me to work at a steady pace rather than get overwhelmed with everything at once. I would revise the first few parts such as the domain modeland system architecture sections to provide a clearer understanding to the reader.Considering the users needs is vital to developing software as at the end of the day they are the ones who want the game app created. The design document was extremely helpful in the designing of the software. Writing out the constraints and different operating systems and recomendations helped me not to get overwhelmed and take the project step by step until there is a clear idea for the software to be developed efficiently and correctly.
